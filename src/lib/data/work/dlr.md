We have a duty to ensure we are keeping our environmental impact to a minimum, so it’s vital that environmental and sustainability considerations are embedded in the way our producers work and how we work with them. We also know our audiences are increasingly aware of environmental themes and issues, and it’s important we reflect these concerns and interests in a more sustainable world in the content we make.
