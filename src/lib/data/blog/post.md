Dear Movie Lover,
I’m writing to you on this occasion to invite you out of your home and into a movie theatre to see a film starring Willem Dafoe, Emily Watson, Finn Wolfhard, Helena Zengel, a gang of Romanian boys, a realistic animatronic puppet, and several people in ape suits. This film, The Legend of Ochi, is my first, and it took seven years to create. We filmed on location in the remote mountain villages of Transylvania. I made over two hundred matte paintings. The sets we constructed atop the highest elevation road-accessible point in Romania were eaten by large bears. This film was an adventure to make, and if you go to the theatre this weekend, I trust you’ll feel that for yourself.
