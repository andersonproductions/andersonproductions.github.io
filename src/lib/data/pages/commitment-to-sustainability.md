> There’s never been a more important moment for creative people to come together and share ideas about how we can engage with climate change. I believe together we have an opportunity to enrich our content, stay relevant to audiences and play our role in looking after the planet we all call home.

We have a duty to ensure we are keeping our environmental impact to a minimum, so it’s vital that environmental and sustainability considerations are embedded in the way our producers work and how we work with them. We also know our audiences are increasingly aware of environmental themes and issues, and it’s important we reflect these concerns and interests in a more sustainable world in the content we make.

We ask the producers we work with to take the following steps to actively reduce the environmental impact of their production and ensure environmental themes are embedded in content on-screen:

- Achieve albert certification and actively reduce the carbon footprint of the production
- Have a conversation with the commissioner about reflecting sustainable themes in the programme on-screen
- Submit an on-screen sustainability form to track the sustainable themes featured in the programme
