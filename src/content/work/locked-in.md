## The storyline

**look away if you don't want any spoilers**

Gemma is sent a blackmail text by an unknown 'K', saying that if she doesn't pay a certain amount of money, 'K' will post a picture online of Gemma kissing Rosie's (Gemma's best friend's) boyfriend. Shortly after receiving the text, Gemma spots that there is a poster in the hallway for a school Talent Show - with the prize for the winner being a substantial sum of money. Gemma resorts to telling her close group of friends about the blackmail she had received in a conversation in the canteen at school - and explains her plan to break into the school during the night to steal the money (to pay the blackmailer).

After breaking into the school, Gemma and her friends realise they are locked in as the rope they used to enter, has fallen in behind them. The group decides to find the money and search for a way out later.

After finding the money, one of Gemma's friends, Linda, is opposed to giving ALL the money to Gemma - and wants to split it. Kaleb and Rosie have to intervene to put Linda back in her place, explaining that they had all agreed on who was getting the money - Gemma.

The following day, Gemma meets up with the blackmailer - who happens to be...... KALEB, a member of her close friend group who had helped them in their heist the night before.
